      Subroutine subprograms RDEQBS and DDEQBS
      advance the solution of the system of  simultaneous first-order differential equations
    




      from a specified value  to a
      specified value  of the
      independent variable x.
    

      On computers other than CDC and Cray, only the
      double-precision version DDEQBS is available. On CDC
      and Cray computers, only the single-precision version
      RDEQBS is available.

Usage:


      For  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),
    

    CALL tDEQBS(N,X1,X2,Y,H0,EPS,SUB,W)



        N
      

        (INTEGER) Number n of equations.
      

        X1
      

        (type according to t) Initial value  of the
        independent variable x.
      

        X2
      

        (type according to t) Final value  of the independent variable x.
      

        Y
      

        (type according to t) One-dimensional array of
        length  N. On
        entry,  , must contain
         . On exit,
         , contains
        approximate values  .
      

        H0
      

        (type according to t) On entry, H0 must
        contain the proposed initial step-length  . On exit, H0 contains the last
        computed step-length (See also Method and
        Notes).
      

        EPS
      

        (type according to t) The requested absolute
        accuracy  .
        (EPS should not be smaller than approximately
         times the
        machine precision).
      

        SUB
      

        Name of a user-supplied SUBROUTINE subprogram,
        declared EXTERNAL in the calling program.
      

        W
      

        (type according to t) Array containing at least
        36*N elements required as working-space.
      


      The user-supplied subroutine SUB should be of the
      form
    

    SUBROUTINE SUB(X,Y,F)


      where the variable X and the one-dimensional arrays
      Y(*) and F(*) are of type t. This
      subroutine must set
    




Method:


      For the first integration step, starting at  , the step-length h is chosen to be
      the smallest of the numbers  for which not more than 9 stages of internal
      extrapolation yield an estimated error less than  . This procedure is repeated until
       is reached. (For
      details, see Ref. 1).
    

Error handling:


      Error D201.1: If the requestec accuracy cannot
      obtained, a message is written on Unit 6, unless
      subroutine MTLSET (N002) has been called.
      For  , or  or  ,
      control is returned to the calling program without any change
      in Y.
    

Notes:


      For well-conditioned systems of equations any reasonable
      value of the initial step length  may be chosen. For ill-conditioned systems,
      the initial value of  may
      be important, and tests with different values are advised. An
      inappropriate choice may lead to wrong results in such cases.
    

      This subroutines is based on an Algol60 procedure given in
      Ref. 1. The adaption for integration over a given interval
      (not only over one step) is due to G. Janin.
