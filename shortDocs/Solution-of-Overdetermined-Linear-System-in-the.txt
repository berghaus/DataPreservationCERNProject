      Subroutine subprograms RCHEBN and DCHEBN
      find the Chebyshev or minimax solution to a set of
      overdetermined linear equations  , i.e. the vector x which
      minimizes
    




      On computers other than CDC or Cray, only the
      double-precision version DCHEBN is available. On CDC
      and Cray computers, only the single-precision version
      RCHEBN is available.

Usage:


      For  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),
    

    CALL tCHEBN(M,N,A,MDIM,B,TOL,RELERR,X,RESMAX,IRANK,ITER,ICODE)



        M
      

        (INTEGER) Number m of equations.
      

        N
      

        (INTEGER) Number  of unknowns.
      

        A
      

        (type according to t) Two-dimensional array of
        dimension (MDIM,d), where  . On entry, A(I,J) must contain the
        coefficients  of matrix
        A. The contents of A is destroyed
        during execution.
      

        MDIM
      

        (INTEGER) Declared first dimension of array
        A, where  .
      

        B
      

        (type according to t) One-dimensional array of
        length  . On entry, the
        first m elements of B must contain the
        vector b. On exit, these elements contain
        the residuals  .
      

        TOL
      

        Tolerance parameter which should be set to a value somewhat
        greater than the machine precision.
      

        RELERR
      

        (type according to t) On entry, RELERR
        should be set to zero if the true minimax solution is
        required. (For RELERR non-zero see
        Notes).
      

        X
      

        (type according to t) One-dimensional array of
        length  . On exit, the
        first n elements of X contain the
        solution vector x.
      

        RESMAX
      

        (type according to t) On exit, RESMAX
        contains the value c of the maximum residual.
      

        IRANK
      

        (INTEGER) On exit, IRANK contains an
        estimate of the rank of the matrix A. (This
        estimate may depend on TOL).
      

        ITER
      

        (INTEGER) On exit, ITER contains the
        number of simplex iterations performed.
      

        ICODE
      

        (INTEGER) On exit, ICODE contains one of
        the following:
 Solution
        x is not unique,
 Solution
        x is unique,
 Calculation
        terminated prematurely because of rounding error.
      


Method:


      Modified simplex method of linear programming applied to the
      dual of the stated minimax problem.
    

Notes:


If RELERR on entry contains a non-zero positive
      value r, RELERR on exit contains a value
      r'<r, and the computed solution 
        x' in X and the maximum residual
        c' in RESMAX are such that
        (c'-c)/c < r', where
        c is the maximum residual corresponding to the
        true minimax solution x. By setting
        RELERR non-zero (e.g. RELERR = 0.1), the
        number of simplex iterations is usually reduced.
      
If RESMAX is within one or two orders of
      magnitude of TOL, the computed residuals in
      B on exit may contain few significant digits, and
      may have been set to zero if  .
      


      The subprograms are based on a Fortran algorithm given in
      Ref. 1.
