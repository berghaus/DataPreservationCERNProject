      Subroutine subprograms RCHPWS, RPWCHS and
      DCHPWS, DPWCHS perform the conversion of a
      finite Chebyshev series to a finite power series (i.e. a
      polynomial) and vice versa.
    

      Thus, given the coefficients 
      ,  of a finite
      Chebyshev series, RCHPWS and DCHWPS
      calculate the coefficients  ,
       of the equivalent
      polynomial:
    




      Conversely, given the coefficients  ,  of a power
      series, RPWCHS and DPWCHS calculate the
      coefficients  ,  of the equivalent
      finite Chebyshev series:
    




      In both cases,  is the
      Chebyshev polynomial of degree j.
    

      Note that sometimes the constant term in the Chebyshev series
      is defined differently, i.e.  instead of  .
      Here, the definition of Ref. 1 is used.
    

      On computers other than CDC or Cray, only the
      double-precision versions DCHPWS and DPWCHS
      are available. On CDC and Cray computers, only the
      single-precision versions RCHPWS and RPWCHS
      are available.
