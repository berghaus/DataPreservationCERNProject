      Subroutine subprograms RRKNYS and DRKNYS
      advance the solution of the system of  simultaneous second-order differential
      equations
    




      where  , by a single
      step of length h in the independent variable
      x.
    

      On computers other than CDC or Cray, only the
      double-precision version DRKNYS is available. On CDC
      and Cray computers, only the single-precision version
      RRKNYS is available.

Usage:


      For  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION),
    

    CALL tRKNYS(N,H,X,Y,YP,SUB,W)



        N
      

        (INTEGER) Number n of equations.
      

        H
      

        (type according to t) The step-length h.
      

        X
      

        On entry, X must be equal to the initial value of
        the independent variable x. On exit, X is
        equal to x+h.
      

        Y
      

        (type according to t) One-dimensional array of
        length  . On entry,
         , must contain
         . On exit,
         , contains
        approximate values  .
      

        YP
      

        (type according to t) One-dimensional array of
        length  . On entry,
         , must contain
         . On exit,
         , contains
        approximate values  .
      

        SUB
      

        Name of a user-supplied SUBROUTINE subprogram,
        declared EXTERNAL in the calling program.
      

        W
      

        (type according to t) Array containing at least
        6*N elements required as working-space.
      


      The user-supplied subroutine SUB should be of the
      form
    

    SUBROUTINE SUB(X,Y,YP,F)


      where the variable X and the one-dimensional arrays
      Y(*), YP(*) and F(*) are of type
      t. This subroutine must set
    




Method:


      Using boldface quantities to denote vectors of length
      n, the computational sequence is as follows:
    




      The error per step is proportional to  .
    

Error handling:


      For  or  , control is returned to the calling
      program without any change in Y or YP.
