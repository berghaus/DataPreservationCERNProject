      Subroutine subprograms RFRDH1, DFRDH1 and
      function subprograms RFRDH2, DFRDH2
      calculate an approximation to the solution y of the
      Fredholm integral equation
    




      over the interval [a,b]. The function
      F must not be identically zero. The interval
      [a,b] may be divided into m
      subintervals  , with
       .
    

      The order  (number of
      abscissae) of the Gaussian quadrature formula used for
      integrating over  is specified
      separately for each subinterval.
    

      Function subprograms RFRDH3 and DFRDH3
      evaluate numerically integrals of the form  where H is an arbitrary function and
      y is the solution of (1).
    

      The following values of  may
      be used: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
      20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80, 96.
    

      On computers other than CDC and Cray, only the
      double-precision versions DFRDH1 etc. are available.
      On CDC and Cray computers, only the single-precision versions

Usage:


      For  (type
      REAL),  (type
      DOUBLE PRECISION), the first step in the solution of
      (1) must be the execution of a statement of the form:
    

    CALL tFRDH1(F,G,M,T,NG,WS,IDIM,N)



        F,G
      

        (type according to t) Names of user-supplied
        FUNCTION subprograms, declared EXTERNAL
        in the calling program. Subprogram F must set
         , subprogram
        G must set  .
      

        M
      

        (INTEGER) Number  of subintervals in [a,b].
      

        T
      

        (type according to t) One-dimensional array of
        dimension (0:d) where  . On entry, T must contain the
        m+1 ordered points of subdivision  , with  and  .
      

        NG
      

        (INTEGER) One-dimensional array of length
         . On entry,
        NG must contain the order (number of absissae)
         of the
        Gaussian quadrature formula to be used in the interval
         .
      

        WS
      

        (type according to t) Two-dimensional array of
        dimensions  . Used as
        working space and for communication between the
        subprograms.
      

        IDIM
      

        (INTEGER) A number  .
      

        N
      

        (INTEGER) On exit,  .
      


      Once tFRDH1 has been called, the function
      subprograms tFRDH2 and tFRDH3 may be
      referenced any number of times without any further call to
      tFRDH1.
    

      In any arithmetic expression,
    

    tFRDH2(F,G,X,WS,IDIM,N)


      has the value  , where
      y is the approximate solution of (1).
    

      In any arithmetic expression,
    

    tFRDH3(H,WS,IDIM,N)


      has the approximate value of  where y is the approximate solution
      of (1).
    

H (type according to t) is the name of a
      user-defined FUNCTION subprogram, declared
      EXTERNAL in the calling program. This subprogram
      must set  .
    

Method:


      Let the sets  and  be defined by
    




 and  are respectively the weights and abscissae
      of the  -point Gaussian
      quadrature formulae corresponding to the interval  . Subprograms RFRDH1 or
      DFRDH1 sets up and solves the following system of
      simultaneous linear equations with unknowns  :
    




      where  .
    

      Function subprogram tFRDH2 calculates  .
    

      Function subprogram tFRDH3 calculates  .
    

Accuracy:


      The accuracy depends upon the extend to which the product
      G(x,t)y(t) can
      be represented by a polynomial of degree  for all x in the interval  .
    

Error handling:


      Error D601.1: In tFRDH1, the system of
      linear equations is singular. A message is written on
      Unit 6, unless subroutine MTLSET (N002) has
      been called.
      If any of the values 
      does not appear in the list given above, a message is written
      on Unit 6 by RGSET or DGSET (D107)
      unless subroutine MTLSET (N002) has been
      called.
