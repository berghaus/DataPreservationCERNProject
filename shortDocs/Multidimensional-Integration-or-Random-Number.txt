DIVON4 is designed for integration of scalar
      functions of several variables, especially functions not
      smooth enough to be integrated reliably using Gaussian
      quadrature. It can also be used effectively to generate
      random points in a multidimensional space, with point density
      given by any bounded function. The heart of the package is an
      algorithm for recursive multi-dimensional partitioning of the
      space into subregions of approximately constant function
      value (minimum range criterion).

      user-supplied FUNCTION subprogram DFUN


Usage:


      The function (integrand) is defined by a user-supplied
      FUNCTION subprogram which must have the name
      DFUN and must calculate the integrand in
      double-precision mode:
    

   FUNCTION DFUN(ND,X)
   DOUBLE PRECISION DFUN,X(ND)
   ...
   DFUN = ...
   ...
   RETURN
   END



        ND
      

        (INTEGER) Number of integration variables.
      

        X
      

        (DOUBLE PRECISION) Array containing the
        coordinates of the point in the integration volume at which
        DFUN is to be evaluated.
