CHTOI converts between a CHARACTER*1 value
      in a 95-character set and INTEGER values in the
      range 32-126 via a look-up table.
    

Structure:


SUBROUTINE subprogram
      User Entry Names: CHTOI, ITOCH


Usage:


    CALL CHTOI(CHAR,INTGR,*label)



        CHAR
      

(CHARACTER*1) Variable or constant (may be a
        substring of a longer string) containing on input the
        character for which the integer equivalent is required.
      

        INTGR
      

(INTEGER) Variable which will contain on output
        the integer equivalent from a look-up table of the input
        character argument. A zero will be returned if the
        character was not found in the table.
      

        label
      

(INTEGER) Label of an executable statement within
        the calling program to which control will be transferred
        should the input character not be found in the table.
      


    CALL ITOCH(INTGR,CHAR,*label)



        CHAR
      

(CHARACTER*1) variable which will contain on
        output the character equivalent from a look-up table of the
        input integer argument. A question mark will be returned if
        the integer is outside the range  inclusive.
      

        INTGR
      

(INTEGER) variable or constant containing on input
        an integer in the range  for
        which the character equivalent is required.
      

        label
      

(INTEGER) Label of an executable statement in the
        calling program to which control will be transferred should
        the input integer be outside the range  .
      


Method:


      A look-up table containing 95 entries is mapped consecutively
      into integers  . The table is as
      follows:
    

 32- 47:   ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / (32 is a blank)
 48- 57: 0 ... 9
 58- 64: : ; < = > ? @
 65- 90: A ... Z
 91- 96: [ \ ] ^ _ `
 97-122: a ... z
123-126: { | } ~


Restrictions:


      This routine is typed in Fortran on a system which includes
      all the above characters. Systems with fewer characters
      available usually make some local translation when they read
      the source for example on CDC NOS/BE the lower case letters
      are translated to upper case. Exact reproducibility of other
      than the subset of characters is not guaranteed.
    

Notes:


      These integer values are the same as for the 8-bit
      ASCII set.
